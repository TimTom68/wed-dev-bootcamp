            I like drinking H<sub>2</sub>O. I also like fractions like <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. The less than symbol
            (&lt;) needs be written as "& l t ;". The amperstan "&amp;" symbol is used at the start, and the semicolon
            ";"
            symbol is used to close these entities. each entity can be used with its name or its number. Like &lt; and
            &#60;
            give the same entity.

            <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild
            species
            such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl <sup><a href="somesource.com">[1]</a></sup> that are originally
            from
            Southeastern Asia. <br>
            <!--makes a break in the text-->
            Rooster or cock is a
            term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is
            a
            capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans now
            keep
            chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they
            were
            also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.

            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
            There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
            literature
